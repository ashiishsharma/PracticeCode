 * <B>Dining Philosophers:</B>
 * <p>
 * In the famous dining philosophers problem, a bunch of philosophers are
 * sitting around a circular table with one chopstick between each of them. A philosopher needs both
 * chopsticks to eat, and always picks up the left chopstick before the right one. A deadlock could
 * potentially occur if all the philosophers reached for the left chopstick at the same time. Using threads
 * and locks, implement a simulation of the dining philosophers problem that prevents deadlocks.
