 * <p><B>Minesweeper</B>:Design and implement a text-based Minesweeper game.</p>
 * <p>Minesweeper is the classic single-player computer game where an NxN grid has B mines (or bombs) hidden across the grid.</p>
 * <p>The remaining cells are either blank or have a number behind them.</p>
 * <p>The numbers reflect the number of bombs in the surrounding eight cells.</p>
 * <p>The user then uncovers a cell. If it is a bomb, the player loses.</p>
 * <p>If it is a number, the number is exposed. If it is a blank cell, this cell and all adjacent blank cells (up to
 * and including the surrounding numeric cells) are exposed.</p>
 * <p>The player wins when all non-bomb cells are exposed. The player can also flag certain places as potential bombs.</p>
 * This doesn't affect game play, other than to block the user from accidentally clicking a cell that is thought
 * to have a bomb.
 *
 * <p>Refer book itself for more detailed solution, since it has no fixed solution</p>
