/**
 * 8.8
 * <p>
 * <B>Othello</B>: Othello is played as follows: Each Othello piece is white on one side and black on the other.
 * When a piece is surrounded by its opponents on both the left and right sides,
 * or both the top and bottom, it is said to be captured and its color is flipped.
 * On your turn, you must capture at least one of your opponent's pieces.
 * The game ends when either user has no more valid moves.
 * The win is assigned to the person with the most pieces.
 * Implement the object-oriented design for Othello.
 * <p>
 *
 * <p> The solution contains the thought process of classes that need to be
 * there, rest of the full code is skipped </p>
 *
 * <p>Refer book itself for more detailed solution, since it has no fixed solution</p>
 *
 * <p>Remember that in many problems, what you did is less important than why you did it. Your interviewer
 * probably doesn't care much whether you chose to implement Game as a singleton or not, but she probably
 * does care that you took the time to think about it and discuss the trade-offs.</p>
