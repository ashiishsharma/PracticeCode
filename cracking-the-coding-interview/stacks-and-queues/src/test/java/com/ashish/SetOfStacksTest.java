/**
 * 3.3
 * Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple.
 * Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous
 * stack exceeds some threshold.
 * Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOf-Stacks should
 * be composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once
 * the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.
 * pop () should behave identically to a single stack (that is, pop () should return the
 * same values as it would if there were just a single stack).
 * *FOLLOW UP
 * Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a
 * specific sub-stack.
