 * <B>Stock Data:</B>
 * <p>
 * Imagine you are building some sort of service that will be called by up to 1,000 client
 * applications to get simple end-of-day stock price information (open, close, high, low).
 * <p>
 * You may assume that you already have the data, and you can store it in any format you wish.
 * <p>
 * How would you design the client-facing service that provides the information to client applications?
 * You are responsible for the development, rollout, and ongoing monitoring and maintenance of the feed.
 * <p>
 * Describe the different methods you considered and why you would recommend your approach.
 * <p>
 * Your service can use any technologies you wish, and can distribute the information to the client applications in
 * any mechanism you choose.
